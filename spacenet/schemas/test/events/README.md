# SpaceNet Event Schema Test Suite

This module contains unit tests for schemas defining events.

This test suite uses Hypothesis property-based testing, so its running time may be comparatively
large in exchange for higher test quality. However, the running time is manageable compared
to any of the property-based tests used.
